## Understanding Product Fields

When you add or edit a product, you'll see a form with several fields. Here’s what each one does:

### Product Name
This is the title of your product as it will appear to customers in your store.

### Product Description
This is the detailed text that appears on the product page.
* You can write in **multiple paragraphs**.
* To make the text box larger, simply **click and drag the bottom-right corner**.

### Product Price
Enter the base price of your product.
* **Important:** Only enter numbers (e.g., `19.99`, not `$19.99`).

### Product Discount
Set a discount percentage for the product.
* Enter only the number. For a 30% discount, type `30`.

## Images and Options

### Product Image Path
This section controls all the images for your product.
* Click **"Choose File"** to upload one or more images.
* The image displayed on the **far left is the main product image** used in product listings.

### Product Options
Here, you can create variations for your products, like size or color.
1.  Click **"Add New Option Type"**.
2.  Enter the **Option Name** (e.g., "Size").
3.  Type a choice (e.g., "Small") and click the **+** button.
4.  Repeat for all choices (e.g., "Medium", "Large").

## Organization and Display

### Product Index
This controls the display order of your products on shop pages. Products with a lower number (like `1`) will appear before products with a higher number (like `10`).

### Product Tree (1, 2, 3)
These fields create the category hierarchy for your product, which is used for navigation and filtering.
* **Product Tree 1:** The main category (e.g., "Apparel").
* **Product Tree 2:** A sub-category (e.g., "Shirts").
* **Product Tree 3:** A further sub-category (e.g., "T-Shirts").

### Product Special Description
This powerful field places your product in special sections on your website.
* **Homepage Sections:** To feature a product on the homepage, enter one of the following (in all caps): `FEATURED PRODUCTS`, `SPECIAL PRODUCTS`, `WEEKLY PRODUCTS`, or `FLASH PRODUCTS`.
* **Custom Top Bar Category:** To create a new category link in the main navigation bar (e.g., "New Arrivals"), simply type that name here.

## Automatic Fields

These fields are handled automatically by the system. You do not need to edit them.

### Product ID
A unique identifier for the product, created automatically. It **cannot be changed**.

### Stripe Price ID
This ID connects the product to your Stripe account for payments. It is **generated automatically** when you save the product.
