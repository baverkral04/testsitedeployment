## The AIDA Framework: A Formula for Sales

AIDA is a classic copywriting formula that works:
* **Attention:** Grab the reader's interest with a strong headline or opening sentence.
* **Interest:** Build interest by highlighting the most exciting features and benefits.
* **Desire:** Create desire by explaining how the product will improve the customer's life.
* **Action:** Tell the customer exactly what to do next (the Call to Action).

## Always Refine the AI's Work

The AI's output is your **first draft**, not the final version. Always review and edit it:
* **Inject Your Personality:** Add your unique brand voice. Is your brand funny? Luxurious? Minimalist? Make sure the text reflects that.
* **Check for Accuracy:** Ensure all technical details and features are correct.
* **Improve Readability:** Break up long paragraphs into shorter ones. Use bold text to highlight key phrases.
