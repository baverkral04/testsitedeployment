## What are Keywords?

Keywords are the words or phrases people type into Google. The key is to find the keywords your ideal customers are using.

* **Short-Tail Keywords:** Broad terms like "shoes" or "coffee." High competition.
* **Long-Tail Keywords:** Very specific phrases like "waterproof hiking shoes for wide feet." Lower competition and much higher chance of a sale. **This is where you should focus.**

You can use a free AI tool like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Claude to do your keyword research in minutes. The key is giving it a great prompt.

## Where to Use Your Keywords (On-Page SEO)

Once you have your keyword list, you need to place them strategically on your site.

#### **Product Titles**
Your product title should be clear and include the most important keyword.
* **Bad:** `Journal - Brown`
* **Good:** `Handmade Brown Leather Journal for Writers`

#### **Product Descriptions**
Naturally weave your primary and secondary keywords into the product description text. Don't "stuff" them in unnaturally.

#### **Image Alt Text**
This is the text that describes an image for search engines and screen readers. When you upload a product image, describe it accurately and include a keyword.
* **Example:** `A close-up of the hand-stitched binding on the brown leather journal.`
