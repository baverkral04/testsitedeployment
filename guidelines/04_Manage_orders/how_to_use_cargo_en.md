### Before You Begin: Verify Your Address

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Before creating your first shipping label, you must ensure your brand's address is valid and correctly formatted.

1.  Navigate to the **"Manage Brand Info"** tab in your dashboard.
2.  Check the **Address** field. It must be in a standard US format: `Street Address, City, State, ZIP Code, Country`.
3.  Save any changes. This address will be used as the "ship from" location for all your orders.
