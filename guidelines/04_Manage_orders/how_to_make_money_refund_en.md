## Step 3: Choose Refund Options

You have a few choices to make before confirming the refund.

* **Amount:**
    * **Full Refund:** By default, Stripe fills in the full amount of the original purchase.
    * **Partial Refund:** If you only need to refund part of the order, you can type a different amount into the box.

* **Reason:**
    * From the dropdown menu, select a reason for the refund. For a standard product return, the best option is usually **"Requested by customer"**.

## Step 4: Confirm the Refund

Once you've set the amount and reason, click the **"Refund"** button. The refund is processed immediately, and Stripe will handle sending the funds back to the customer's original payment method.

### What Happens Next?

* **Timing:** It typically takes **5-10 business days** for the refund to appear on the customer's bank or card statement.
* **Fees:** Stripe's original processing fees for the transaction are typically not returned to you.
* **Status:** The payment status in your Stripe dashboard will update to **"Refunded"** or **"Partially Refunded"**.
