### How to Manage a Return Request

This guide explains how to review and process return requests from your customers through the Admin Dashboard.

---
## Step 1: Find Return Requests

First, navigate to the order management page.

1.  Hover your cursor over the **profile icon** in the top navigation bar.
2.  From the dropdown menu, click on **Manage Orders**.
3.  On the order management page, click on the **"Return Requested"** tab to see all pending requests.

## Step 2: Review the Request

There are two types of return requests you may see:

#### **Before Shipment**
If the product has **not been shipped yet**, the customer can request a simple order cancellation. You will see a return request without any images or reasoning.

#### **After Shipment**
If the product **has already been shipped**, the customer must provide a reason for the return. You will see an explanation from the customer and any images they uploaded.

## Step 3: Process the Return

You have two options for every return request: Approve or Decline.

#### **If you APPROVE the request:**
1.  Click the **"Approve"** button.
2.  You must then **contact your customer directly via email** to provide them with instructions on how to ship the product back to you.
3.  Once you receive the returned product, log in to your **Stripe account**, find the original transaction, and issue a refund to the customer.

#### **If you DECLINE the request:**
1.  Click the **"Decline"** button.
2.  A text box will appear. You **must provide a clear reason** for the rejection (e.g., "The return period has expired," or "The item is ineligible for return."). This reason will be shared with the customer.
